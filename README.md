# Bruteforce-Pillarseed-bit-reversal
Bruteforces possible lower 32 bits of a seed using the pillar seed.
To input a Pillar seed you will have to open the Bruteforcer.java and find line 9:
if (pillarseed == ) {
                 |
                Pillarseed
As shown above you just input your pillarseed there.
To run the programm you need to compile it. You can easely use intellij idea community edition, it will compile and run the file for you.
At the bottom a window will open up and it will output all the results(takes about 2 minutes or so and outputs exactly 65536 possible lower 32 bits of a seed).
I recommend using ctrl + a and then ctrl+c to copy everything and then remove the first and last line which are not supposed to be an output.
